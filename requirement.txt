✅ AI-Powered Test Automation Platform – Feature List
🚀 Goal: Auto-generate and run browser-based tests using AI to understand Figma or screen images, with zero manual coding.
🧩 1. Input & UI Understanding
Feature	Description
✅ Upload multiple Figma frames or screenshots	Accept design inputs (Figma export or image files)
✅ (Optional) Connect via Figma API	Import frames directly from a Figma project
✅ AI-powered UI detection (no OCR)	Detect inputs, buttons, labels, messages using vision + language model
✅ Auto-detect component types	Classify each element: button, input, label, etc.
✅ Smart selector generation	Use data-testid, placeholder, text, aria-label, etc.
✅ Detect layout & screen flow	Infer screen navigation (e.g., login → dashboard)
✅ Flow visualization	Generate editable flowchart of the UI flow
✅ User confirmation/editing	Let user review and tweak the generated flow

🧠 2. Test Case Generation
Feature	Description
✅ AI-generated test cases per flow	For login, signup, errors, happy paths, etc.
✅ Support for multiple test types	E.g., positive, negative, edge cases
✅ Mapping between elements and actions	E.g., "click this", "fill that", "expect toast"
✅ Inline validation checks	Auto-checks required fields, error handling
✅ Scenario variations	E.g., 3 test users, missing inputs, invalid passwords
✅ Export to Playwright/Puppeteer	Generates runnable .test.js or .spec.ts files

📊 3. Test Data Generator
Feature	Description
✅ Auto-generate dummy data	Usernames, emails, passwords, edge cases
✅ Define schema per screen	E.g., login needs 1 valid + 2 invalid users
✅ Reusable dataset manager	Shared user pools across flows
✅ Manual override	Allow input of custom test data

🧪 4. Test Runner (Browser Automation)
Feature	Description
✅ Playwright-based test execution	Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
✅ Headless or visible browser mode	For automation or debug
✅ Automatic element handling	Clicks, fills, uploads, hovers
✅ Wait and sync logic	Wait for DOM, network, animations
✅ Parallel and batch testing	Multiple flows at once
✅ CLI + UI runner support	Run from command line or dashboard

🧭 5. Outcome Detection & Assertion
Feature	Description
✅ Smart outcome handler after interaction	Detect redirect, toast, error, modal, etc.
✅ URL change detection	Identifies page navigation
✅ Toast/success detection	Checks for .toast, [role="alert"], etc.
✅ Error/message detection	Checks .error, aria-live, .form-error, etc.
✅ Modal/popup detection	Dialogs, overlays, confirmation popups
✅ AI-based change analysis (optional)	Before/after DOM analysis using GPT or model

📈 6. Reporting & Logs
Feature	Description
✅ HTML test report with results	Visual log of test status
✅ Screenshots and video recording	Per step (only on failure or always)
✅ Step-by-step logs	Detailed browser actions
✅ Diff view (optional)	Compare expected vs. actual DOM/screenshot

🖥️ 7. Web Dashboard
Feature	Description
✅ Upload and manage Figma/screens	Project-oriented workspace
✅ Visual flow editor	Modify screen-to-screen transitions
✅ View test cases and edit steps	Low-code interface
✅ Run tests from dashboard	Trigger and monitor browser tests
✅ View logs, screenshots, results	All in one place
